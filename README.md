0x1D. C - Binary trees

Task 00:(0-binary_tree_node.c)
a function that creates a binary tree node
Prototype: binary_tree_t *binary_tree_node(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);
Where parent is a pointer to the parent node of the node to create
And value is the value to put in the new node
When created, a node does not have any child
Your function must return a pointer to the new node, or NULL on failure

Task 01:(1-binary_tree_insert_left.c)
a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node
Prototype: binary_tree_t *binary_tree_insert_left(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);
Where parent is a pointer to the node to insert the left-child in
And value is the value to store in the new node
Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL
If parent already has a left-child, the new node must take its place, and the old left-child must be set as the left-child of the new node

Task 02:(2-binary_tree_insert_right.c)
a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node
Prototype: binary_tree_t *binary_tree_insert_right(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);
Where parent is a pointer to the node to insert the right-child in
And value is the value to store in the new node
Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL
If parent already has a right-child, the new node must take its place, and the old right-child must be set as the right-child of the new node.

Task 03:(3-binary_tree_delete.c)
function that deletes an entire binary tree

Prototype: void binary_tree_delete(binary_tree_t *tree);
Where tree is a pointer to the root node of the tree to delete
If tree is NULL, do nothing

Task 04:(4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c)
a function that checks if a node is a leaf

Prototype: int binary_tree_is_leaf(const binary_tree_t *node);
Where node is a pointer to the node to check
Your function must return 1 if node is a leaf, otherwise 0
If node is NULL, return 0
